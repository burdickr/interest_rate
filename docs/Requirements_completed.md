DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Focused on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves.

10 minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your visualization must include a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)

Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e. non-standard graph or chart)

A dashboard page with multiple charts all updating from the same data

A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover. (Time delay for chart???)

Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.)

Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views
